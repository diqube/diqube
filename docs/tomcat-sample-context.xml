This file is a sample "context xml" that can be used to deploy diqube-ui in Tomcat.

diqube-ui has several configuration properties, of which one is currently mandatory:

diqube.ticketPublicKeyPem. This holds the path to a file containing a RSA public key in OpenSSL PEM format. That public
key corresponds to the private/public key pairs that are installed on the diqube-servers under configuration property 
"ticketRsaPrivateKeyPemFile". This means that this is the public key belonging to the private keys that sign new
Tickets.

Deployment of diqube-ui to Tomcat should be done using a file like this, as this allows to specify the configuration
parameters. To deploy, do the following:

* Adjust the values in this file according to your local paths.
* Copy the file into the Tomcat directory conf/Catalina/localhost
* Tomcat will deploy a new web app with the same context name as this xml file.
